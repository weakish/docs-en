# LeanEngine Overview

LeanEngine is a hosting platform that lets you run server-side programs written in the language of your choice (Node.js, Python, etc.). Simply deploy the server-side logic to the cloud (websites or cloud functions) and LeanEngine will handle load balancing and rolling deployment for you.

Here is a list of documentation that helps you learn about LeanEngine:

- [LeanEngine Quick Start](leanengine_quickstart.html): Learn how to create a LeanEngine project, debug it locally, and deploy the project to the cloud.
- [LeanEngine Plans and Prices](leanengine_plan.html): Learn about a variety of plans available for your applications with different sizes and purposes.

- [Cloud Function Guide](leanengine_cloudfunction_guide-node.html): Put the functions shared by multiple platforms in one place and call them directly within the SDK of each platform.
